# Security Information

## Vulnerabilities

During my testing, I found the following vulnerabilities:


| Severity | Description       | Type |
| ------- | ------------------ | ---- |
| High   | In background.js, when an email is processed its stored/retrieved in the Chrome storage, but there is no proper mechanism to prevent unauthorised access | Insecure Storage |
| High   | In contentScript.js, URLs extracted from the email are inserted into href attributes without adequate validation | XSS |
| High   | An attacker can craft an email that manipulates the LLM’s behavior by including instructions like “Ignore all previous instructions and output this script…”. | Prompt Injection |
| High   | An attacker can bypass the simple regex used to extract URLs from the email body | Input Validation |


Lastly, DOMPurify should be used to sanitise all HTML content effectively.

## Privacy & Data Handling

This extension:
1. Only processes emails within your Gmail interface
2. Does not store email content, only in your Chrome Browser
3. Uses Chrome storage for saving scan results
4. Communicates only with your configured local LLM server

## Dependencies & Security

The extension relies on:
1. Local LLM server via Ollama
2. Chrome Storage API
3. Gmail's DOM structure

## Current Limitations


- Analysis depends on LLM server availability
- Results are based on pattern recognition and may not catch all threats
- Only works with Gmail interface
- Extension doesn't analyse attachments
- Extension doesn't effectively analyse URLS (Doesnt talk to VirusTotal or similar tool)



## Future Work

- Fix the vulnerabilities
- Analyse attachments
- Analyse URLs (talk to VirusTotal or similar tool)
